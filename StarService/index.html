                STAR SERVICE DOCUMENTATION
                <br><br>
                "Star Service" is a game I made using the PIXI.JS framework for graphics, and the HOWLER.JS framework for audio. I made all the art and audio assets myself, aside from the selling noise, which is an edited version of the register noise from Sonic CD.
                <br><br>
                I made this game in about a week - my initial idea for this game was to make a small puzzle game, but that idea quickly got way too out of scope very fast. Instead I opted for this - a small clicker, with no finite objectives or goals. To keep this game in scope, I used simple black and white graphics which I made in the application "Aseprite," an excellent piece of software for making pixel-art. For the music and sound effects, I used FL Studio 12.

                HOW TO PLAY
                <br><br>
                Click on the items in the top shelf to add them to the "repair" machine. Every so often, a customer will come and ask for a certain type of repair mixture. Make it for them, before time runs out! It's not a big deal if you miss it, they'll come back eventually. The goal of this game is just to make as much money as you can.
